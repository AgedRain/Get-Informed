<h3>Covid-19 history</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The Covid-19 virus started in Wuhan China when someone there consumed an animal containing the virus</li>
  <li>The Virus then rapidly spread across the globe causing widespread panic forcing governments to quickly come-up with a plan</li>
  <li>The sudden appearance of the Virus in the US and lack of direction by the US president caused its citizens large amounts of stress <br>
    created for a short period of time a shortage of toilet paper as people rushed to stores to buy as much as they could get their hands on</li>
  <li>

<h3>The Vaccine</h3>

    who recorded and posted her-self receiving the vaccine on social media <br>
    which she then proceeded to answer question her followers had about the whole process and what symptoms the vaccine could give.
